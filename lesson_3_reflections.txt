When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When I need to share my code with someone else.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because is better to control when is the best moment to share the changes. If the changes were automatically up-to-date, the remote repository could be in a invalid state. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Forks are clones of remote repositories from GitHub to another user remote repository using the same repository name. Clones are duplication of repository made locally from remote repositories to local repositories. Branches are a copy of a repository to start a new line of independent development. Forks are used to let you edit a current repository from another user avoiding edit direcly on the another user repository, you ill be able to change the files on your current user repository. Clones are used to get a local copy of remote repositories. Branches are used to copy the current repository letting you change the files for a possible merge in the future.
 
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

Easy to compare with the local updates and to ease the merging.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

Via e-mail. No use of a lot of commands, but it will be difficult to trace the updates and more communication represented by a lot of number of e-mails will be necessary.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
